Hi, I’m Dan

I’m a computer engineer with a strong focus on building performant, reliable, and thoughtfully-designed software systems. My work spans low-level engineering, full-stack development, and experimentation with emerging technologies. Outside of engineering, I’m a photographer, car enthusiast, and lifelong learner who approaches every discipline with curiosity and rigor.

What I Work On

Systems & embedded development

Backend engineering with an emphasis on performance, maintainability, and clarity

Tools, automation, and technical workflows that reduce friction and increase throughput

Security, privacy, and application analysis, including static/dynamic techniques

Experimentation with game development pipelines and real-time systems

What I’m Learning Right Now

Advanced Android static/dynamic analysis workflows

Cross-platform game development tooling

Cloud-native architecture patterns

Technologies & Tools I Use

Languages: C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript

Frameworks: React, Node.js, Android

Tools: Docker, GitHub Actions, MobSF, Android Studio, Linux

Other: Photography post-processing workflows, performance tuning, reverse engineering basics

My Approach

I value clarity, correctness, and maintainability. I prefer building solutions that scale, documenting decisions, and keeping development processes intentional and disciplined.
